## Project Overview
This project, developed by Eileen Blessing, implements a deep learning model to predict customer churn in the telecommunications sector. By analyzing customer behavior and usage patterns, the model identifies customers who are likely to discontinue their services. This tool aids telecom operators in developing targeted strategies to retain their customer base.

## Features and Functionalities
- **Churn Prediction**: Leverage machine learning to predict the likelihood of customers churning.
- `churnapp.py`: The main application script that runs the churn prediction process.
- `createModel.py`: Script containing the machine learning model's creation and training logic.
- `label_encoder.joblib`, `scaler_model.joblib`: Serialized preprocessing tools for data transformation.
- `Nbest_model.pkl`: The serialized version of the trained model, optimized and ready for predictions.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Installation Instructions
Follow these steps to install and run the churn prediction model on your local system:

1. Clone this repository to your machine.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Install the necessary Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application using: python churnapp.py
